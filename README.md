#ODIN - RECIPES

As the title says, this project will have multiple recipes of any kind.

What I'll be doing is, create the main page which is the index.html and create five more.

Each of this other pages will be a country, and each of them will contain recipes from it.

Each country page will contain two of the most famous recipes from its location.

I will be using HTML only.

The will achieve the expected result using the following:

1. Headers
2. Paragraphs
3. Images
4. Links
